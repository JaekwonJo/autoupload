## 🏆 Final Version Features (V2)
This version represents the **Final Stable Release**. It includes strict safety rules to prevent errors and a professional HUD interface.

### ✨ New in Final Ver
- **Human Action HUD**: A detailed dashboard showing the bot's internal state (Fatigue, Typo Probability, Hesitation, Focus Loss) in real-time.
- **Strict Input Safety**:
  - **No Random Clicks**: The bot never clicks randomly. Clicks are reserved *only* for the "Submit" button.
  - **Shift+Space/Enter**: Prevents accidental IME toggling or premature sending.
- **Silent Launch**: `Flow_Start.vbs` launches the bot without any distracting black console windows.
- **Separate Log Window**: A dedicated, large window to view logs and prompt previews comfortably.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Installation
Run **`1_필수라이브러리_설치.bat`** (Only needed once).

### 2. Execution (Silent)
Double-click **`Flow_Start.vbs`**. 
*(Or use `2_오토_프로그램_실행.bat` if you prefer).*

### 3. Setup
1. **Prompts**: Edit `flow_prompts.txt` (separated by `|||`).
2. **Coordinates**:

## 🛠️ Core Features

### 📊 Dashboard & HUD
